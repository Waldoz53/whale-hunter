# Whale Hunter
or, a game inspired by Moby Dick by Herman Melville.

## Controls
Your ship always moves forward.
W: Speeds up movement.
S: Slows down movement.
A/D: Turn left or right (very slowly!)
Left click: Aim with your mouse, and click to shoot a spear. Spears are "readied" every 5 seconds.

## Objective
It's in the name of the game. The game has the one mechanic, hunting whales. My goal was to make a game with a single mechanic add as much polish as possible.

## To Do List:
1. Add the special secret screens
3. Add sound
4. Add music
5. Animate ship's rudder + sail
6. Animate whales
7. Change fonts?
7. Change timer to a circle that refills or something
7. Track the last whale you hit
7. Slow spears do no damage
8. Spears have a drawn line?
9. Load up to 3 spears?
10.
