# Whale Hunter
or, a game inspired by Moby Dick by Herman Melville.

## Controls
Your ship always moves forward.
W: Speeds up movement.
S: Slows down movement.
A/D: Turn left or right (very slowly). You turn faster if you are moving slowly (S key) and holding A/D.
Left click: Aim with your mouse, and click to shoot a spear. Spears are "readied" every 5 seconds.
